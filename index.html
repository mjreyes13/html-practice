                    Water Lilies
                    </a>
                    <p>Water Lilies by Claude Monet (French, 1840- 1926)
                    One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all,
                    ”said Claude Monet, referring to his late masterpieces,
                    the water landscapes that he produced at his home
                    in Giverny between 1897 and his death in 1926. 
                    These works replaced the varied contemporary subjects
                    he had painted from the 1870s through the 1890s with a single,
                    timeless motif—water lilies. The focal point of these paintings was
                    the artist’s beloved ﬂower garden, which featured a water garden 
                    and a smaller pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. 
                    In his first water-lily series (1897–99), Monet painted the pond environment,
                    with its plants, bridge, and trees neatly divided by a fixed horizon.
                    Over time, the artist became less and less concerned with conventional
                    pictorial space. By the time he painted Water Lilies, which comes
                    from his third group of these works, he had dispensed with the horizon
                    line altogether. In this spatially ambiguous canvas, the artist looked down,
                    focusing solely on the surface of the pond, with its cluster of vegetation
                    ﬂoating amid the reﬂection of sky and trees. Monet thus created the image
                    of a horizontal surface on a vertical one.

                    Delphi
                    </a>
                    <p>
                        Claude Lorrain (Claude Gellée; French, 1600-1682).
                        This painting of the ancient city of Delphi (in what is now Greece)
                        presents a delicate rendering of the glowing Mediterranean atmosphere.
                        Like many other foreign artists drawn to the ruins of antiquity,
                        French painter Claude Lorrain was fascinated with the ancient
                        Roman Empire. Here, he evoked a serene, bucolic world akin to the 
                        poetic vision of the ancient Roman writer Virgil, depicting the ruins
                        restored to their original glory as Claude imagined. 
                        This painting was commissioned by Cardinal Carlo Camillo Massimi,
                        an important and erudite collector in Rome.

                        Frederic Edwin Church (American, 1826–1900)
                        View of Cotopaxi brings together in visual form scientific,
                        religious, political, and cultural ideas in the mid-19th century.
                        Inspired by German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt’s concept
                        of ecological interconnectedness, Frederic Edwin Church traveled
                        to South America to meticulously study the tropical landscape.
                        The artist produced at least ten finished paintings of the
                        Ecuadorian volcano, this one completed in his studio just before
                        his second visit to the region. For Church and other Christian viewers,
                        nature, with all its creative and destructive wonders,
                        was evidence of divine power. The painting likewise reflected an
                        imperialist vision, as US government officials eyed Latin America
                        as a site for territorial expansion and conquest.

                        Carl Blechen (German, 1798–1840)
                        Lush palms and overgrown greenery dominate this view of
                        the Palm House, designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel to
                        display the Prussian royals’ collection of tropical plants.
                        This painting plays with the boundaries between architecture
                        and nature, imagination and reality: vines curl around soaring
                        columns and bowed fronds evoke archways. Carl Blechen populated
                        his dazzling place-portrait with a leisure scene derived from
                        colonialist fantasies of non-European women. 
                        The artist dressed the ﬁgures in rich textiles that echo
                        the building’s colors and motifs, as if he considered them an
                        extension of the decor.

                        The short career of Carl Blechen, a pivotal ﬁgure in
                        nineteenth-century German painting, marked the transition
                        from Romanticism to a more realistic view of nature.
                        Inspired in part by his encounter with the Italian landscape
                        and light during a trip he made around 1828 or 1829,
                        Blechen developed a ﬂuid technique that enabled him to
                        capture ﬂeeting atmospheric effects. He often used his
                        landscapes as settings for mysterious ﬁgures, reﬂecting
                        his early contact with Romantic painting and theater.

                        After a design by Guy-Louis Vernansal (French, 1648–1729) and others
                        Woven at the Manufacture Royale de Beauvais under the direction of
                        Pierre and Etienne Filleul (codirectors, 1711–22) France, Beauvais

                        This tapestry is part of a suite that portrays scenes from the lives
                        of the Chinese emperor Shunzhi (r. 1644–61) and his son,
                        the emperor Kangxi (r. 1661–1722). 
                        The Emperor Sailing shows the elder emperor seated in a ceremonial
                        dragon boat as it pulls away from a quay. Members of the imperial 
                        family and their attendants watch the launch from underneath an 
                        arcade, in close proximity to a crane and a tortoise that together 
                        symbolize their well-wishes for the monarch. 
                        Philippe Behagle, then director of the Beauvais tapestry workshop, 
                        commissioned the design of this tapestry suite in the mid-1680s to 
                        cater to the French court’s increasing fascinating with China. 
                        As an allegory of good governance, the series makes manifest the 
                        parallels, first propounded by French Jesuit missionaries in China, 
                        between Louis XIV and Kangxi.

                        John Henry Twachtman (American, 1853–1902)
                        During the last decade of his life, John Henry Twachtman frequently
                        painted views of the landscape surrounding his home in Greenwich,
                        Connecticut. In a departure from typically barren images of winter,
                        he enjoyed depicting the beauty of the frozen terrain, believing that it 
                        was conducive to contemplation and regeneration. 
                        The dense layers of paint in Icebound mimic the accumulation of snow
                        on frozen ground, and the sinuous curves that define the snow and ice
                        against the water suggest movement in an otherwise tranquil environment.
                        Almost square in format, the painting’s harmonious composition exemplifies
                        Twachtman’s opinion that “never is nature more lovely than when it is snowing.”
