          Water Lilies
        </a>
        <p>Water Lilies by Claude Monet (French, 1840- 1926)
            One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all,
            ”said Claude Monet, referring to his late masterpieces,
            the water landscapes that he produced at his home
            in Giverny between 1897 and his death in 1926. 
            These works replaced the varied contemporary subjects
            he had painted from the 1870s through the 1890s with a single,
            timeless motif—water lilies. The focal point of these paintings was
            the artist’s beloved ﬂower garden, which featured a water garden 
            and a smaller pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. 
            In his first water-lily series (1897–99), Monet painted the pond environment,
            with its plants, bridge, and trees neatly divided by a fixed horizon.
            Over time, the artist became less and less concerned with conventional
            pictorial space. By the time he painted Water Lilies, which comes
            from his third group of these works, he had dispensed with the horizon
            line altogether. In this spatially ambiguous canvas, the artist looked down,
            focusing solely on the surface of the pond, with its cluster of vegetation
            ﬂoating amid the reﬂection of sky and trees. Monet thus created the image
            of a horizontal surface on a vertical one.

        <p>
        Claude Lorrain (Claude Gellée; French, 1600-1682).
        This painting of the ancient city of Delphi (in what is now Greece)
        presents a delicate rendering of the glowing Mediterranean atmosphere.
        Like many other foreign artists drawn to the ruins of antiquity,
        French painter Claude Lorrain was fascinated with the ancient
        Roman Empire. Here, he evoked a serene, bucolic world akin to the 
        poetic vision of the ancient Roman writer Virgil, depicting the ruins
        restored to their original glory as Claude imagined. 
        This painting was commissioned by Cardinal Carlo Camillo Massimi,
        an important and erudite collector in Rome.

        <p>
        Frederic Edwin Church (American, 1826–1900)
        View of Cotopaxi brings together in visual form scientific,
        religious, political, and cultural ideas in the mid-19th century.
        Inspired by German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt’s concept
        of ecological interconnectedness, Frederic Edwin Church traveled
        to South America to meticulously study the tropical landscape.
        The artist produced at least ten finished paintings of the
        Ecuadorian volcano, this one completed in his studio just before
        his second visit to the region. For Church and other Christian viewers,
        nature, with all its creative and destructive wonders,
        was evidence of divine power. The painting likewise reflected an
        imperialist vision, as US government officials eyed Latin America
        as a site for territorial expansion and conquest.

          Palm House
        </a>
        <p>
        Carl Blechen (German, 1798–1840)
        Lush palms and overgrown greenery dominate this view of
        the Palm House, designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel to
        display the Prussian royals’ collection of tropical plants.
        This painting plays with the boundaries between architecture
        and nature, imagination and reality: vines curl around soaring
        columns and bowed fronds evoke archways. Carl Blechen populated
        his dazzling place-portrait with a leisure scene derived from
        colonialist fantasies of non-European women. 
        The artist dressed the ﬁgures in rich textiles that echo
        the building’s colors and motifs, as if he considered them an
        extension of the decor.

        The short career of Carl Blechen, a pivotal ﬁgure in
        nineteenth-century German painting, marked the transition
        from Romanticism to a more realistic view of nature.
        Inspired in part by his encounter with the Italian landscape
        and light during a trip he made around 1828 or 1829,
        Blechen developed a ﬂuid technique that enabled him to
        capture ﬂeeting atmospheric effects. He often used his
        landscapes as settings for mysterious ﬁgures, reﬂecting
        his early contact with Romantic painting and theater.

        <p>
        After a design by Guy-Louis Vernansal (French, 1648–1729) and others
        Woven at the Manufacture Royale de Beauvais under the direction of
        Pierre and Etienne Filleul (codirectors, 1711–22) France, Beauvais

        This tapestry is part of a suite that portrays scenes from the lives
        of the Chinese emperor Shunzhi (r. 1644–61) and his son,
        the emperor Kangxi (r. 1661–1722). 
        The Emperor Sailing shows the elder emperor seated in a ceremonial
        dragon boat as it pulls away from a quay. Members of the imperial 
        family and their attendants watch the launch from underneath an 
        arcade, in close proximity to a crane and a tortoise that together 
        symbolize their well-wishes for the monarch. 
        Philippe Behagle, then director of the Beauvais tapestry workshop, 
        commissioned the design of this tapestry suite in the mid-1680s to 
        cater to the French court’s increasing fascinating with China. 
        As an allegory of good governance, the series makes manifest the 
        parallels, first propounded by French Jesuit missionaries in China, 
        between Louis XIV and Kangxi.

        John Henry Twachtman (American, 1853–1902)
        During the last decade of his life, John Henry Twachtman frequently
        painted views of the landscape surrounding his home in Greenwich,
        Connecticut. In a departure from typically barren images of winter,
        he enjoyed depicting the beauty of the frozen terrain, believing that it 
        was conducive to contemplation and regeneration. 
        The dense layers of paint in Icebound mimic the accumulation of snow
        on frozen ground, and the sinuous curves that define the snow and ice
        against the water suggest movement in an otherwise tranquil environment.
        Almost square in format, the painting’s harmonious composition exemplifies
        Twachtman’s opinion that “never is nature more lovely than when it is snowing.”
